Project Title:
Music Database Manager

Project Description:
A basic application using a GUI to allow a user to search for songs, albums, and artists in a given database. 
It also allows the user to add new songs, albums, and artists to the database.
The application is admittedly rather simple, and not a very sophisticated GUI for a system managing music. 
This was mostly created to try creating a program in Java that allowed searching and manipulation of a database. 
The database itself was taken from the Java Programming Masterclass covering Java 11 & Java 17 course by Tim Buchalka on Udemy.com. 

Prerequisites and usage guide:
Make sure to have at least JDK version 13 installed. 
Install the JavaFX SDK. 
Install the JAVA IDE of your choice. 
Download the Zip, unzip it, and rename the folder to "musicDatabase". 
Import/open the aforementioned folder. 
Configure to add the drivers from the Drivers folder.
